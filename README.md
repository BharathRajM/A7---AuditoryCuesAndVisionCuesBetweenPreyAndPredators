# Comparison between only visual transmission and both auditory and visual transmission in groups under predation
This repository contains a NetLogo model simulating groups of prey under predation.

This model was built on an existing model on frontal vision and flocking behaviour that was created for a previous course. That base model is contained in `MahadevaRaoFelthamModelMsc2020.nlogo`.

## Running the model
The model can be run in [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). It was built in NetLogo 6.1.1 - other versions may work, but are not recommended for running this model. To run the model, simply download `DMAS_v1_VisionCues.nlogo` and load it in NetLogo.

You can initialize the model with the `Setup` button - this creates the initial conditions, spawning some prey and predators. You can then press `Go` to start running the model, or `Step` to step through it slowly. Surrounding the main screen in the middle are various options for changing the model parameters. The output can be read in the graphs to the right.

## Missing components
Not everything we want to implement has been implemented yet. Currently, predators and visual information transmission between prey are implemented in the model. Auditory information transmission is not yet implemented - we plan to have that part finished by next week.
