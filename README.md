# DesignOfMultiAgentSystems
Submission of project towards Design Of MultiAgent Systems (WMAI004-05.2020-2021.1A)

-Initial notes:
  - The model is based on a previous model about frontal vision and flocking behaviour for a previous course entitled "Advanced Self Organization of social systems"
  - Preys and auditory cues are added to observe how this affects the survival rate of the flocks
